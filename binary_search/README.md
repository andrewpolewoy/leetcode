<b>#704. Binary Search</b>
<br><b>Easy</b>

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1<br>
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.<br>
<b>Example 1:</b><br>
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4<br>

<b>Example 2:</b><br>
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2<br>
Output: -1<br>
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1<br>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>
1 <= nums.length <= 10 to the 4th power<br>
-104 < nums[i], target < 10 to the 4th power<br>
All the integers in nums are unique.<br>
nums is sorted in ascending order.
