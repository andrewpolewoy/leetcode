<b>#75. Sort Colors</b>
<br><b>Medium</b>

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.<br>
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.<br>
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.<br>

<b>Example 1:</b><br>
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]<br>
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]<br>

<b>Example 2:</b><br>
Input: nums = [2,0,1]<br>
Output: [0,1,2]<br>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>
n == nums.length<br>
1 <= n <= 300<br>
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.<br>
