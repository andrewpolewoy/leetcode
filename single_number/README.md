<b>#136. Single Number</b>
<br><b>Easy</b>

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.<br>
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity O(n) and use only constant extra space O(1).<br>

<b>Example 1:</b><br>
Input: nums = [2,2,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>

<b>Example 2:</b><br>
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]<br>
Output: 4<br>

<b>Example 3:</b><br>
Input: nums = [1]<br>
Output: 1<br>

<b>Constraints:</b><br>
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10 to the 4th power<br>
-3 * 10 to the 4th power <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10 to the 4th power<br>
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
